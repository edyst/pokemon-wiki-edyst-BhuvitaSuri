                games released in <br> 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also

                    <p style="margin:auto;">Water is one of the three basic elemental types <br> along with Fire and Grass, which constitute the <br>

                          players. Water is the most common type with <br>
                          over 100 Pokémon, which are based on a wide <br> variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

                      early stages of the games so choosing the Fire <br> variation starter is often a plus.

              <h3>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h3>
              <ol>
                <b>  <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li></b>
                  <ul>
                      <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu 
                          is essential for every trainer, but <br> you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain.
                           Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of <br> generating vast amounts of 
                           electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon
                            trainers <br> should be able to answer.
                        </li>
                        <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
                  </ul> <br>
                <b>  <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li></b>
                  <ul><li>
                    Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive
                     upgrades are needed if you're <br> looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later 
                     routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game,<br> you've reached the point where you're presented with 
                     the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button <br> mashing at all is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Answer is Master Ball

                          main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.
